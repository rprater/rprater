# Hi there! My name is Robert.

I am currently studying Engineering at Ryerson Univeristy. I have over two years of internship experience working as a Software Engineer and a Data Scientist. I have worked for startups such as Balance Accounting and multi-billion dollar companies such as <a href='https://hatch.com'>Hatch</a> and <a href='https://magna.com'>Magna</a>. Most importantly, I love to program!
