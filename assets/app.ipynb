    "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that focuses on the use of objects to represent and manipulate data. In OOP, data and behavior are encapsulated within objects, which can communicate with each other through methods, messages, and inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In OOP, the key concepts are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Classes:__ A class is a blueprint or template that defines the attributes and behavior of a particular type of object. It defines the properties and methods that an object of that class will have.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Objects:__ An object is an instance of a class. It represents a specific entity that has a state and behavior defined by its class.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Encapsulation:__ Encapsulation refers to the concept of hiding the internal details of an object and exposing only the necessary information through its public interface. This helps to keep the code modular and maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Inheritance:__ Inheritance is the mechanism by which a class can inherit properties and behavior from a parent class. This allows for code reuse and helps to create a hierarchy of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP allows for the creation of reusable code, making it easier to maintain and update large projects. It also encourages good programming practices, such as modular design and separation of concerns. OOP is widely used in many programming languages, including Python, Java, and C++.\n",
